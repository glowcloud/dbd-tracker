# Dead by Daylight Tracker

A website for tracking your Dead by Daylight matches and statistics. 

Created with [React](https://react.dev), [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) and [MUI](https://mui.com).
Uses [Supabase](https://supabase.com) for data storage with email authentication for user access.

## TODO

- filtering matches/charts by date
- community charts/statistics
- login form validation
- home page revamp
- styling revamp
